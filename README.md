## MyAnimeList Studios and Viewership Dataset

> MyAnimeList is an online platform where all things anime, manga, manhwa or webtoon converge. It's one of the most popular brands that allows _otakus_ keep track of their anime, or manga lists. Regular updates can also be tracked via email and membership platforms.
>
> This dataset intends to study what studio preferences are when it comes to making anime productions as well as the viewership's sentiment towards those productions. 
>
> I intend to infer if there is a bias from the viewership that flactuates when it comes to rating anime as well as the studios' preferences when it comes to the rating, timing and themes of their released titles.

## Summary of Findings

> From the exploration of the cleaned datasets, I intend to highlight shifts the volume of productions peaking during the Fall and Spring while noticalbly declining during the Winter. 

> There is a sufficient argument that this has resulted in fewer Winter titles ranking as highly as Fall or Spring titles due to a probable drop in excitement by the anime fanbase. 

> It's worth noting that PG-13 demographic titles are the most popular title rating from the study. This ascertains the viewership prefers the titles to have wranges of content that deal with more mature themes.
